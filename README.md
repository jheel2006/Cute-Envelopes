## Why I Made This

I just wanted to build something small, simple, and nice to look at. Iâ€™d been thinking about how little thingsâ€”like a kind message or a fun animationâ€”can actually make your day a bit better. So this page is kind of like a digital pick-me-up for anyone who stumbles across it (or for myself when I need a break).
